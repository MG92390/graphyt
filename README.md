npx expo start in your VSCode Terminal and it should work.

Hello everyone, I'm trying to make this app work and it's like one of my life goals'.
I wanted an efficient way to improve my mathematical skills and understanding of basic functions so I think drawing them would be the best way to learn.
However I'm unfortunate because I can get the grid and x and y axis but I can't draw any function on this grid...

If any of you could tell me what to do, I would be more than thankful.

Kind Regards,
Mohamed G.
